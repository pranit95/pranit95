# Hi, I’m Pranit Jogwe 👋

Senior Frontend Engineer specializing in **React, Next.js, and frontend system design**.  
I build **scalable, performance-focused dashboard applications** with a strong emphasis on
**maintainability, data handling, and user-centric workflows**.

Most of my professional work is in **private repositories**, as part of enterprise and product teams.

---

## What I work on

- Frontend architecture for **large, data-heavy applications**
- **Dashboard systems** with authentication and role-based access control (RBAC)
- Server-state management using **React Query** (pagination, caching, error handling)
- Performance optimization (render profiling, lazy loading, code splitting)
- Reusable component systems and frontend platforms

---

## Tech focus

- **React, Next.js (App Router), JavaScript (ES6+)**
- Frontend system design (CSR / SSR trade-offs)
- State & data management (React Query, Redux)
- UI performance & scalability

---

## Notes

- Public repositories here are **selected demos and architecture examples**
- Enterprise production code is maintained in **private repositories**
- I value clean abstractions, clear communication, and async-friendly workflows
